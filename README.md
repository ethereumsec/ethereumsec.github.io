# ethsec.io

This is an open Ethereum security blog which lives at **https://ethsec.io**

If you're interested in contributing, see the `dev` branch and/or add an issue.

That branch houses the generation scripts for the static site and has the [**Open Ethereum Security Course**](https://github.com/ethereumsec/course) as a submodule.

`master` branch of this project just has the static output which you see live.
